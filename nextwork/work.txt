There should be a section in workspaces for blindspots

for threads, ensure to have a menu to remove them
ensure agent icons are blinking or green bright when they are doing work

at the bottom at a counter of tokens used

in workspaces add section for sprint health and show current and past
also add a ticket section
also add a resources section and show which people are busy vs free for this sprint

if I upload a list of names under a resources banner, it should add the ones that are not there
resources can be across projects, but they can be tagged to the current project... add an option to filter

when I paste a list of jira ticket exports, the tickets and assignees will be associated with this project

when I click on objectives, add a button to add objective for this sprint (give it a date picker) and add actions for flag them completed, at risk or remove them
