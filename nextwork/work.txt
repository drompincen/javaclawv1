I have the UI running while you run the tutorial script
the UI is not showing that things are happening (agents blinking or tokens used)
project dropdown is not showing new projects, but you should change all tutorial scripts to use the same project name
I'm not able to remove resources or tickets
The icon when there are items in the work spaces (counter) should be light yellow and black font when the count is >0
checklist items show 2/6 but it should show all and their status and also ability to remove and mark done
when changes done, run all tests
run all scenario test in testMode
