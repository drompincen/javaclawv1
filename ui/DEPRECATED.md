# Deprecated: Swing UI Module

This module has been replaced by the web-based cockpit served from the gateway's static resources.

**Use the web UI instead:**
1. Start the gateway: `java -jar gateway/target/javaclaw-gateway-*.jar`
2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

The web UI provides all 8 workspaces (Intake, Threads, Objectives, Plans, Reminders, Checklists, Reconcile, LinkHub), agent controls, activity stream, and inspector panel with a Bloomberg-terminal green-on-black aesthetic.

The mockup that informed the web UI design is preserved at:
`ui/src/test/resources/static/javaclaw_cockpit_intake_v2_mock.html`
