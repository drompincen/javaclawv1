Sprint 42 Planning — Payment Gateway
Date: 2026-02-18
Attendees: Alice Chen, Bob Taylor, Joe Martinez, Sarah (PM)

Sarah: Let's lock down Sprint 42. We have three main objectives this sprint.

Objective 1: Complete Payment Processing Engine refactor
- Outcome: All 3 handlers migrated to strategy pattern
- Measurable signal: PAY-201, PAY-202, PAY-203 all closed
- Risk: Joe is assigned to all 3 — if he gets pulled into webhook work this slips
- Linked tickets: PAY-201, PAY-202, PAY-203
- Status: COMMITTED

Objective 2: Webhook Integration queue prototype validated
- Outcome: RabbitMQ integration spike complete, load test passing at 500 msg/s
- Measurable signal: Spike ticket closed, consumer ticket at least 50% complete
- Risk: Dependency on Stripe sandbox access — Bob needs credentials by Wednesday
- Linked tickets: PAY-204, PAY-205
- Status: COMMITTED

Objective 3: Merchant Onboarding wizard design approved
- Outcome: Wireframes reviewed by UX team, S3 upload API draft ready
- Measurable signal: Wireframe review meeting scheduled, API spec PR open
- Risk: UX team has limited availability — may push to Sprint 43
- Linked tickets: PAY-206, PAY-207
- Status: PROPOSED

Resource Allocation:
- Joe Martinez: Engineer, capacity 100%, availability 80% (20% on-call rotation). Skills: Java, Spring Boot, MongoDB, React. Assigned 22 SP across 5 tickets — OVERLOADED
- Alice Chen: Engineer, capacity 100%, availability 100%. Skills: Java, AWS, S3, PostgreSQL. Assigned 5 SP on 1 ticket — has bandwidth
- Bob Taylor: Engineer, capacity 100%, availability 60% (shared with Platform team). Skills: RabbitMQ, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform. Assigned 5 SP on 1 ticket — reasonable load

Action Items:
- Sarah to get Stripe sandbox creds for Bob by Wednesday
- Alice to pick up PAY-206 wireframe review to unblock Joe
- Joe to focus on PAY-201 first (highest risk)
- Bob to timebox RabbitMQ spike to 3 days
