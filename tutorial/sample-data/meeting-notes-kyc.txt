KYC Architecture Review — 2026-02-18, 10:00 AM

Attendees: Joe Martinez, Alice Chen, Bob Taylor

Topic 1: Evidence Service Refactor

Joe presented the current Evidence Service architecture. The monolithic handler
processes all document types (passport, utility bill, bank statement) in a single
class with 1,200 lines. We agreed to split into a strategy pattern with one handler
per document type. Joe will own the refactor — target completion by end of Sprint 42.

Alice raised concerns about backward compatibility with the existing REST API.
We decided to version the endpoint: /api/v2/evidence while keeping /api/v1/evidence
for 90 days.

Action: Joe to create Jira tickets for each document handler (passport, utility, bank).

Topic 2: KYC Screening Integration

Bob walked through the third-party screening API (ComplyAdvantage). Rate limits are
100 req/min on the sandbox, 1,000 req/min in production. We need a queue-based
approach to avoid hitting limits during bulk onboarding.

Decision: Use RabbitMQ with a leaky-bucket consumer. Bob will prototype this week.

Action: Bob to spike the queue integration and share results by Friday.
Action: Alice to review the data privacy implications of storing screening results.

Topic 3: ORR Readiness

Alice reminded the team that the Operational Readiness Review is in 3 weeks.
Checklist items still open: load test results, runbook documentation, rollback
procedure, and monitoring dashboards.

Decision: Each team member owns 2 checklist items. Joe: load test + runbook.
Alice: monitoring dashboards + alerting. Bob: rollback procedure + incident response.

Action: All items must be complete 1 week before ORR date.
