Payment Gateway Architecture Review — 2026-02-18, 10:00 AM

Attendees: Joe Martinez, Alice Chen, Bob Taylor

Topic 1: Payment Processing Engine Refactor

Joe presented the current Payment Processing architecture. The monolithic handler
processes all payment methods (card, bank transfer, digital wallet) in a single
class with 1,200 lines. We agreed to split into a strategy pattern with one handler
per payment method. Joe will own the refactor — target completion by end of Sprint 42.

Alice raised concerns about backward compatibility with the existing REST API.
We decided to version the endpoint: /api/v2/payments while keeping /api/v1/payments
for 90 days.

Action: Joe to create Jira tickets for each payment handler (card, bank transfer, wallet).

Topic 2: Webhook Integration

Bob walked through the payment provider webhook API (Stripe). Rate limits are
100 req/min on the sandbox, 1,000 req/min in production. We need a queue-based
approach to avoid missing events during high-volume settlement windows.

Decision: Use RabbitMQ with a retry/backoff consumer. Bob will prototype this week.

Action: Bob to spike the queue integration and share results by Friday.
Action: Alice to review the data security implications of storing webhook payloads.

Topic 3: PCI Compliance Readiness

Alice reminded the team that the PCI Compliance audit is in 3 weeks.
Checklist items still open: penetration test results, runbook documentation, rollback
procedure, and monitoring dashboards.

Decision: Each team member owns 2 checklist items. Joe: penetration test + runbook.
Alice: monitoring dashboards + alerting. Bob: rollback procedure + incident response.

Action: All items must be complete 1 week before audit date.
