Topic 1: Merchant Onboarding Flow Redesign

The current onboarding takes 14 steps across 3 screens. Analytics show 40% drop-off
at the document upload step. Joe proposed consolidating to a single-page wizard with
progressive disclosure.

Decision: Reduce to 7 steps. Combine business verification and document upload into
one step. Add a progress bar and estimated time remaining.

Action: Joe to create wireframes by Wednesday.
Action: Alice to update the API to support partial submission (save draft).

Topic 2: Document Upload Performance

Alice reported that large PDF uploads (>10MB) are timing out on the current
synchronous endpoint. We need to switch to async upload with progress tracking.

Decision: Use presigned S3 URLs for direct browser-to-S3 upload, then notify the
backend via webhook. This removes the file size constraint entirely.

Action: Alice to implement the presigned URL endpoint this sprint.
Action: Joe to update the frontend upload component to use the new flow.
