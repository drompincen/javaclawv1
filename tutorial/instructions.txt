IMPORTANT: All scripts MUST be run from WSL (Linux), NEVER from Windows/PowerShell/cmd.exe.
Do NOT use powershell.exe, cmd.exe, or any Windows interop commands in scripts.
The ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in ~/.bashrc — source it if not already in the environment.

Before running tutorials:
  1. Clean up MongoDB contents (but do NOT delete the agents collection)
  2. Start the server: cd gateway && mvn spring-boot:run (from WSL)
     Wait for "Started JavaclawApplication" or equivalent in the log before proceeding.
  3. Verify the API key: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be in the environment (check ~/.bashrc)
  4. Verify LLM connectivity: GET /api/config/provider must NOT return "No API Key"
  5. If no API key is found, FAIL immediately with a clear error message
  6. Do NOT run tutorials with --testMode — tutorial tests validate real LLM grounding

Scenario tests (run-scenarios.sh) use --testMode with scripted responses.
Tutorial tests use real LLM and MUST fail without connectivity.
