clean up the mongodb contents before running but do not delete the agents collection
run the scenarios and check the results in both rest apis and mongodb
remember that the server will be started by me using a real llm api behind the agents

IMPORTANT: Tutorial tests MUST use the real LLM (Anthropic/OpenAI) — NEVER testmode.
Before running any tutorial test:
  1. Verify LLM connectivity: GET /api/config/provider must NOT return "No API Key"
  2. If no API key is found, FAIL immediately with a clear error message
  3. Do NOT run tests with --testMode — tutorial tests validate real LLM grounding
  4. The ANTHROPIC_API_KEY must be set at the OS level or via --api-key / Ctrl-K
  5. If the key is set at the OS level but not visible in the current terminal,
     read it via: powershell -Command [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('ANTHROPIC_API_KEY','User')
     and push it to the server via POST /api/config/keys

Scenario tests (run-scenarios.sh) use --testMode with scripted responses.
Tutorial tests (run-tutorial-tests.sh) use real LLM and MUST fail without connectivity.
